# GTECH731_HousingAnalysis
A analysis on housing data from Milwaukee, WI was performed for a final project in a course called Geocomputation. The analysis used univariate and bivariate regression to assess what variables had an impact on the sale price of the house. Machine learning for prediction of housing prices was in the original plan, but due to timing conflicts ti was omitted for this final project. This analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebook.
